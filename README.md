<h1> Devation Clustering for Time-series data </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
Project consists of chronologically clustering an initial load/demand profile for the IEEE 18-bus for a given threshold value. The threshold value is the standard deviation of pariwise elements in an array. <b> Problem: </b> Since energy system operators are making decisions reactively based on the conditions at a given time, alot of computations are redundant as similar solutions apply to similar system conditions. <b> Solution: </b> Track load/demand profile changes for significant system changes in real-time that may result in a significant/new solution and remeber solution to avioid redundant computations.  

<ul>
  <br/>
  <li> Part 1: Create a function to implement and track solution 
  <li> Part 2: Visualize solution implemented at various thresholds
  <li> Part 3: Visualize level of data distortion when using solution
</ul>

<h2> Environment </h2>
<ul>
  <li><b> Python 3.0+ </b>
  <li><b> Google Colab </b>
</ul>
